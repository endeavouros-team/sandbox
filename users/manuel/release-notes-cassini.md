# Release notes for Cassini ISO

## Apps

### Welcome
- Added a **Notification Area** in the Welcome window for critical news.
- Added a button for ranking the EndeavourOS mirrors.

### Other
- A temporary (active for a few months) pacman hook in package `eos-hooks` to move the EndeavourOS repository definition before Arch repository definitions in file `/etc/pacman.conf`. This can help mitigate possible future package problems.
